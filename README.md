\#1gam January
===========

**Actually this turned out not to be my January entry, as I forgot that Global Game Jam was this month. (Check out my actual entry here.)[https://github.com/chaosed0/ggj_2015/]**

Repo for my (Edward Lu) entry for [1 game a month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/), January 2015. Looks like it's shaping up to be a lesser mario clone.
